Singleton

It is also a creational Design pattern.

When do we need this?

1. When the state of the object needed to remains same irrespective of the other factors (unlike User object that holds info specific to user)
2. Database instance object will remain same during entire runtime 
3. Configurations,caching
4. Shared resources like file object
