Factory Method

It is a creational Design pattern and it is used When the type of object (products) is determined at runtime

When do we need this?

1. When the exact type of object is determined at runtime (eg. based on user inputs or env variables)
2. When you decouple the logic of creation object at client side.
3. When the object creation process is complex or requires multiple steps.
