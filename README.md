# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are general, reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They help make code more modular, flexible, and maintainable.

## Types of Design Patterns

There are three main categories of design patterns:

1. **Creational**
2. **Structural**
3. **Behavioral**

### 1. Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns aim to abstract the instantiation process, making it more flexible and reusable.

- **Builder**  
  A pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

- **Prototype**  
  Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype. This approach helps to avoid the expense of creating objects from scratch.

- **Singleton**  
  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **Factory Method**  
  Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Abstract Factory**  
  Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 2. Structural Design Patterns

_Work in Progress_  
These patterns deal with object composition and typically involve relationships between entities.

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

_Work in Progress_  
These patterns focus on communication between objects, how they interact and delegate responsibilities.

### Future Updates

I will continue updating this README to include detailed explanations and examples for **Structural** and **Behavioral** design patterns. Stay tuned!
